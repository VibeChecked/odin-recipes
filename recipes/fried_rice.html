    <h3 style ="color: darkgoldenrod">Egg Fried Rice</h3>
    <p><em>Here are the 8 ingredients needed</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>White rice, cooked and chilled</li>
        <li>Eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>Scallions & garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Light soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Salt & white pepper </li>
        <li>Light soy sauce</li>    
        <li>Neutral cooking oil (olive oil isn’t suitable)</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h4>Preparation Phase (Rice)</h4>
    <p><em>Long grain or short grain rice is fine, although jasmine rice is the best choice (Most restaurants use it for fried rice). 
           It creates a fluffier texture than the short-grain variety which is more starchy </em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Day leftover rice is best. When it comes to plain steamed rice, it is preferred to be soft and a little sticky. 
            However, intending to fry it the next day, make it on the dry side.</li>
        <li>Wait till cooked rice is completely cooled, then store it in the fridge until you’re ready to fry. 
            Refrigeration helps to dehydrate and firm up the grains.</li>
        <li>Just before frying, loosen the grains as much as possible</li>
        
    </ol>
    <h4>Cooking Phase (Rice)</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>First the eggs. Lightly beat the eggs until the white and yolk are well incorporated. Scramble the eggs into small pieces. Dish out to set aside</li>
        <li>Next, the rice. Add a little oil and fry minced garlic until it browns a little. Stir in the rice. Flip and toss constantly to heat the rice evenly. 
            If there are still some clumps, press with a spatula to separate the rice grains. </li>
        <li>Combine and Season. After rice is hot, put in the scrambled egg and scallions. 
            Add soy sauce, sesame oil, salt and white pepper. Give everything a good stir to evenly distribute the seasonings.</li>
        
    </ol>
    <p>Note: It’s perfectly fine to use a skillet/frying pan. <b>If non-stick, make sure not to heat it up empty.</b></p>
